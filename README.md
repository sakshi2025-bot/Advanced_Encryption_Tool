Task 4 :Advanced Encryption Tool ‚Äì AES-256 File Encryption & Decryption üîê

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a Python-based application designed to securely encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256, one of the most trusted encryption standards worldwide. This tool combines strong cryptography with a user-friendly interface, making it ideal for students, professionals, and organizations who need to protect sensitive data.

Key Features ‚ú®

AES-256 Encryption: Uses AES-256 in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for both confidentiality and data integrity.

Supports All File Types: Works with text files, PDFs, images, spreadsheets, multimedia files, and more.

User-Friendly GUI: Built with tkinter, allowing easy file selection, password input, and one-click encryption/decryption.

Secure Password-Based Key Derivation: Uses PBKDF2 to convert your password into a strong 256-bit AES key.

Authenticated Encryption: Detects any tampering or corruption of encrypted files.

Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

Enter a Password üîë

The user enters a secure password in the GUI.

Encrypt a File üîí

Select the file to encrypt.

The tool reads it as binary data and encrypts it using AES-256-GCM.

Output: a .enc file containing the encrypted content, nonce, and authentication tag.

Decrypt a File üîì

Select the encrypted .enc file.

Enter the same password used during encryption.

The tool decrypts the file and restores the original content exactly, including images, multi-page documents, or embedded media.

If the password is incorrect, the tool alerts the user and prevents decryption.

Why It‚Äôs Impactful üåü

Data Security: Protects files from unauthorized access using one of the strongest encryption standards available.

Ease of Use: Anyone can encrypt/decrypt files without programming knowledge.

Integrity Verification: Ensures files have not been tampered with during storage or transmission.

Versatile Application: Perfect for personal use, academic projects, corporate documents, or secure file sharing.

Professional Use Cases üíº

Securely sharing confidential PDFs, Word documents, or spreadsheets.

Protecting research papers, project reports, or proprietary files.

Encrypting sensitive images or multimedia content before storage or upload.

Demonstrating cryptography and data security concepts in academic or professional projects.

Conclusion üèÅ

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a robust and reliable solution for secure file encryption and decryption. By combining AES-256 encryption, authenticated security, and an intuitive interface, it ensures that sensitive data remains confidential, intact, and easily accessible to authorized users.
